ISO7816 Prog release notes.

This program requires an ISO7816 reader writer. These can be purchased for
less than $100.00 or built for around $30.00. There is a schematic.jpg file
enclosed for building it.

You may modify the source code, the only limitations that are placed are 
1.) Neither the source code supplied or any modifications to it shall be
    sold. In other words I don't want you to make money off it.
2.) Don't upload the code claiming it as your own. In other words I really
    dislike plagurism.

Any comments or questions are greatly appreciated and will be answered as
time permits me. e-mail to esginc@gate.net

Hope you enjoy.
